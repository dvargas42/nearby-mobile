## üõ∏ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before getting started with Nearby, ensure your runtime environment meets the following requirements:

- [Node 22.7](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)


## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

**Clone the project and access the folder**

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/dvargas42/nearby-mobile.git
```
**Access the extras folder and copy the api.zip file to another location and unzip it. Inside the unzipped folder**

```bash
# Install the dependencies
$ npm i

# To run locally
$ npm run start

# Well done, api is started
```

**Create credential on Google Maps**

1. Access the link below and **follow the 3 steps** to add the Google Maps Platform map service to your project:

  - [https://developers.google.com/maps/get-started](https://developers.google.com/maps/get-started)

2. In the first step, you will need to **create your Google Cloud account** (don't worry, there will be no cost included)

3. Create a **new project** to be managed on this Google Cloud Console platform, linked to your account (ex: Nearby App Android)

4. Search for keys in the top search bar, see image, click on the ‚Äú**+ CREATE CREDENTIALS**‚Äù button and choose **API Key**

5. Paste the key into the AndroidManifest.xml file

    <img alt="manifest" src="./.github/android-manifest.png" width="60%">


**Configuring a smartphone or simulator on Android Studio**

1. Run the ifconfig command on Linux or ipconfig on the Windows terminal to obtain the PC's IP.


2. The last step is to change the IP of the NearRemoteDataSource.kt file to the IP acquired in the previous step in LOCAL_HOST_PHYSICAL_BASE_URL variable. That is if you want to use your smartphone. 

    <img alt="IP1" src="./.github/ip1.png" width="60%">

3. If you want to use the simulator, just make the BASE_URL variable receive the LOCAL_HOST_EMULATOR_BASE_URL variable. 

    <img alt="IP2" src="./.github/ip2.png" width="60%">

4. Now is run the project in Android Studio.
